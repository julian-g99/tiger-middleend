	\author{Chengming Gu, Paul Gibert}
	\maketitle

	\begin{section}{Architecture}
		This project has the following components: IR Instruction class, parser methods, IR generation methods, control flow graph class, optimizer methods, and a main script for running. Program execution starts by parsing all the instructions, passing it to the optimizer, and then outputting the final IR.
		\begin{subsection}{Intermediate Representation}
			We have decided to encode every possible line in tiger IR code as an IRInstruction class, this includes all the obvious suspects, but also:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Function boilerplate (start and end signature, declaration, variable lists)
				\item Labels
				\item Function calls
			\end{itemize}
			The only "line" that isn't considered to be an IR Instruction by us is an empty line. Each instruction encodes information that include but is not limited to:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item type/opcode
				\item a list of arguments
				\item some properties about the instruction, such as:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item whether it's a def/use
						\item the variables it writes/reads
						\item whether it's a branch
					\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
		\end{subsection}

		\begin{subsection}{Control Flow Graph}
			For a given program, there are exactly as many CFGs generated by our program as there are functions. This choice is because we are not optimizing across functions, so it makes sense to give a separate control flow graph for each of the functions. A Control Flow Graph encapsulates the following information/behavior:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The list of instructions in this control flow graph
				\item An adjacency list
				\item Some helper methods that do things like:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Getting the kill set of a def
						\item Getting the predecessor/successors of a def
						\item Removing an instruction from the CFG
					\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
			It's worth noting that each basic block in our codebase is exactly one IR Instruction, and this includes all the types that we don't normally consider to be instructions. For those types, its gen set and kill set are empty, and it just passes control from the previous instruction to the next instruction in order. We initially attempted to use a maximal basic block, but that presented some challenges that made us reconsider and just single-instruction basic blocks. For this same reason, we also do not have a class for basic blocks.
		\end{subsection}

		\begin{subsection}{Optimize}
			The optimizer contains functions for running dead code elimination using fixed point algorithm as well as copy propagation. However, as noted in a later section, copy propagation is incomplete in the sense that it either doesn't eliminate enough instructions, or it results in IR code that's not valid.

			Regardless, the way that we optimize the code (assuming both dead code and copy propagation are to be performed) is to do a first pass of dead code, a pass of copy propagation, and another pass of dead code. Note that in our implementation, after a single round of optimization, we actually output an IR file, and start the next round by parsing that IR file. The reason for doing this is twofold:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This helps debug as we can see what each phase is doing individually, to see where any bugs might come from
				\item This also makes the line number correction easier (or not necessary at all) in our code, since there are some places which use line numbers and other places that use the index of an instruction in the CFG. This is a potential area for refactoring.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{subsection}
	\end{section}

	\begin{section}{Implementation Language}
		Our final language of choice is python 3.8. We initially decided to use C++ as an opportunity to learn the language, but eventually decided to switch to python since there were some compiler discrepancies between members of the team (in particular how clang and g++ optimize loops differently).

		In any event, there are some unique advantages that python provides that makes it easy to do this project:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Builtin functions that do things like trimming whitespace away from strings
			\item Builtin set data structure that also allows all the common set operations
			\item OOP capabilities
			\item Array slices
		\end{itemize}
	\end{section}

	\begin{section}{Challenges}
		As described before, we ran into a lot of issues with c++. This is partially due to lack of familiarity we had with the language, but also because of the more verbose nature of c++. While it can still do the same things that python does, having builtin functions and list comprehension and array slices make things much easier.

		Once we refactored our codebase to python, there weren't any significant issues we ran into.
	\end{section}

	\begin{section}{Known bugs}
		As mentioned earlier, in its current state, copy propagation does not work.
	\end{section}

	\begin{section}{Potential Improvements}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Fix copy propagation
			\item Refactor the code so that there is consistent usage of line number vs index in the CFG across the entire codebase
		\end{itemize}
	\end{section}

	\begin{section}{Usage instructions}
		\begin{subsection}{Version requirements}
			Any installalation of python 3 should work. We implemented and tested our code using python 3.8, but since we didn't use any 3.8 features, 3.7 should work as well. There shouldn't be any packages that need be installed, but if python reports the absence of any package, install with pip.
		\end{subsection}

		\begin{subsection}{Running the optimizer}
			To run the optimizer, simply using the \textit{main.py} file. When ran with the -h flag or without providing necessary flags, a help menu will show up that details the command line flags that need to be passed in.

			As an example, one might run the code as follow: \\
			\begin{verbatim}
				python main.py --input="public\_test\_cases/sqrt/sqrt.ir" \
				--output=="public\_test\_cases/output/sqrt.ir" --dead
			\end{verbatim}
		\end{subsection}
	\end{section}

	\begin{section}{Test Results}
		We will only include results of dead code here, since copy does not work.

			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		As can be seen, our output matches the compiler B result exactly. The criteria that we've constrained in code for copy propagation seems to be too tight, so that in most cases it doesn't actually replace any copies.
